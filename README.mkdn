Unmaintained
============

This code dates to back when I was trying to build C++ abstractions to enable
more resable, maintainable, and robust embedded code. It turned out to be way
easier to achieve all of those things with Rust, so this library is now
unmaintained.

Embedded Template Library
=========================

This is my collection of reusable embedded code.  I found myself either
rewriting or copying and pasting code like this into each project, so I
centralized it here.

This is intended to be used as a submodule.  It's designed to be used in
projects that do not rely on toolchain facilities like libc, libstdc++,
or startup code, because I'm weird like that.

The tests are in a separate repo for now.

**Caveat hax0r:** this code is currently subject to change at my whims.  I am
not currently supporting a 'released' version.  (This is mostly true because I
haven't heard from anyone who wants to use it.)
